# SwapiAngular

## Core TODO
- SW logo header
- Pull SWAPI character data by episode number
- Display data in table
- Button selectors for different episode numbers
- Input box to search character names
- Table data sorted by column headers
- Styling

## Stretch Goals
- State management (save data from API call into application state to lower the API requests as a user switches episodes)
- When a user switches episodes, play scrolling SW episode intro
- Skip intro button
- Skip intro check box (saved in application state)
- Music

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
